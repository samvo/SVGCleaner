=== Remove attributes with default values

We can remove attributes with default values if they are not covered by the parent elements.
Some attributes do not support an inheritance, so we can remove them
without checking a parent elements.

In the example below we have a `circle` element with a `fill` and a `stroke` attributes,
which have default values. We can't remove a `fill` from a `circle`, because than the rect
will be filled with a red, but a `stroke` can be easily removed.

<svg>
  <g fill="red">
    <circle fill="black" stroke="none"
            cx="50" cy="50" r="45"/>
  </g>
</svg>
SPLIT
<svg>
  <g fill="red">
    <circle fill="black" cx="50"
            cy="50" r="45"/>
  </g>
</svg>
