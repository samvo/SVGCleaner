=== Ungroup groups

Groups, aka `g` element, is one of the main SVG structure blocks,
but in a lot of cases they do not impact rendering at all.

Groups are useless:
 - if the group is empty
 - if the group has only one children
 - if the group doesn't have any important attributes

Then we can ungroup it and remove.
