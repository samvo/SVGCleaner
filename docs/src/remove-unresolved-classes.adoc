=== Remove unresolved classes from `class` attributes

The `class` attribute can contain a list of class selectors,
but not all of them may link to the style sheet defined in the file.

This option will remove such selectors.

*Note:* you can't prevent class attribute resolving anyway. This option should be used
just to keep unresolved classes in the `class` attribute when you define them elsewhere.
So you should disable it to get such behavior.
