=== Reset default flags to `no`

Most of the cleaning options are enabled by default.
This flag allows to disable them all at once.

It can be useful if you need only few cleaning options.

Note that this flag applies only to options with the `<FLAG>` type.
Options like `indent` will still use default values.

CLI argument: `--no-defaults`
