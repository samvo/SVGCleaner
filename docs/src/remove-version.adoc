=== Remove `version` and `baseProfile` attributes

Remove `version` and `baseProfile` attributes from the `svg` element.

Some applications can rely on them, so someone may want to keep them.
Even throw they usually useless.

////
<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="tiny">
  <circle fill="green"
          cx="50" cy="50" r="45"/>
</svg>
SPLIT
<svg>
  <circle fill="green"
          cx="50" cy="50" r="45"/>
</svg>
